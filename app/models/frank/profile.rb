    ### Encryption
    # attr_encrypted :email, key: encryption_key, :encode => true
    # attr_encrypted :phone, key: encryption_key, :encode => true

    ### stores the email to uppercase so that searches for the encrypted value are case insensitive
    # def email=(value)
    #   write_attribute(:encrypted_email, value.downcase)
    # end
  end
